// The work shrinks by a fraction (usually half) each step, so it barely grows even as n gets huge. 
// Each loop cuts the search space in half. Searching 1,000 items takes about 10 comparisons; searching 1,000,000 items takes about 20. That's the power of logarithmic growth-doubling the input barely adds any work.
